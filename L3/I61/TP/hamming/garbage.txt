I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings.
I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life.
I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in.
I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day.
I have talked to gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.
You may have heard of me.
